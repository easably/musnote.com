# Piano Basics for Beginners

Learning to play the piano is an exciting journey that opens up a world of musical possibilities. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refresh your skills, understanding the basics is crucial for building a strong foundation.

## Getting Started

### Proper Posture
- Sit up straight with your back supported
- Keep your feet flat on the floor
- Position yourself at the center of the keyboard
- Maintain relaxed shoulders and arms

### Hand Position
- Curve your fingers naturally
- Keep your wrists level with the keyboard
- Use the tips of your fingers to press keys
- Maintain a relaxed grip

## Basic Techniques

### Finger Numbers
Piano technique uses a numbering system for fingers:
- Thumb: 1
- Index finger: 2
- Middle finger: 3
- Ring finger: 4
- Pinky: 5

### Scales and Chords
Start with the C major scale and basic triads. These fundamental building blocks will help you understand music theory and improve your playing.

## Practice Tips

1. **Start Slow**: Begin with simple exercises and gradually increase tempo
2. **Daily Practice**: Even 15-30 minutes daily is better than long sessions once a week
3. **Use a Metronome**: Develop consistent timing and rhythm
4. **Focus on Accuracy**: It's better to play slowly and correctly than fast and sloppy

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Rushing through pieces
- Poor posture
- Neglecting finger exercises
- Not using a metronome
- Skipping warm-up exercises

Remember, every pianist started as a beginner. Be patient with yourself and enjoy the learning process!
